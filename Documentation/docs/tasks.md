## Tasks to be performed
Defining the tasks would give us a clear picture of all the packages, softwares and hardwares required to complete this project. This is considered as the main section because rest of the sections depends on this. Any task missed out would lead to selection of wrong actuatos and sensors. And the whole process should be done again if there are any changes in this step. So, a thorough understanding and definition of tasks is very important.
