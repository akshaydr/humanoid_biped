## Tasks to be performed
Defining the tasks would give us a clear picture of all the packages, software and hardware required to complete this project. This is considered as the main section because the rest of the sections depends on this. Any task missed out would lead to the selection of wrong actuators and sensors. And the whole process should be done again if there are any changes in this step. So, a thorough understanding and definition of tasks are very important.

The following are the tasks to be peroformed by the humanoid robot:
