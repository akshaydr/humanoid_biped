## Objective	
For any project, defining the objective or problem statement is the first step. Objective is nothing but the purpose of the project. We will have to answer to why, what and where questions while defining the objective. These are nothing but why do we need to build this project? What is the purpose or outcome of the project? Where will this be useful in the realworld?
