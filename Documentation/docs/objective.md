## Objective	
For any project, defining the objective or problem statement is the first step. Objective is nothing but the purpose of the project. We will have to answer to why, what and where questions while defining the objective. These are nothing but why do we need to build this project? What is the purpose or outcome of the project? Where will this be useful in the real-world?  

The main objective of this project is to assist in the social inclusion of elderly person and young person with disabilities. It is found that because of societal changes, social inclusion is going to be one of the major issue. Presently, the world is aging. Over 13% of worldâ€™s population is comprised of old aged. This is going to rise 3% every year according to survey conducted by US in 2018. So, we are building a development
platform to test hardware framework in assisting these people. The hardware framework can act
as a readymade platform to develop, test and deploy new software and features for suitable kind
of application.
