## Flow chart 
Once the objective and tasks to be performed are listed, then the next step is to draw a flowchart of the system. This will give a rough idea of the entire system. For any robot, there are three main parts which are important when talking in the programmatic point of view. Such as,

 1. Drive
 2. Controller
 3. Feedback
 
These are to be elaborated and divided into bits and pieces based on the tasks a robot is supposed to perform.
