# The Humanoid Project
This documentation contains the overall workflow of the Humanoid project. This can act as a guide to start any robotics project using Robot Operating System. This guide would give faster and better results in completing the project. It mainly guides in programmig robots using ROS.  

## Robot Operating System
Robot Operating System, is an open source framework for getting robots to do things. ROS is meant to serve as a common software platform for people who are building and using robots. This common platform lets people share code and ideas more readily and, perhaps more importantly, means that you do not have to spend years writing software infrastructure before your robots start moving

The following checklist will guide you through any robotic project using ROS:
 1. Defining the objective of the robot
 2. Listing down all the tasks a robot should perform 
 3. Drawing a rough flowchart of the entire system
 4. Finding packages and wrappers to perform certain tasks 
 5. Listing down nodes and topics required
 6. Listing down services and actions
 7. Selecting actuators and sensor
 8. Selecting controller
