# Humanoid Robot Ajit 2.0
This robot is built at KLE Technological University as an Institutional Research Project by students of Automation and Robotics Departments Akshay DR, Karthik Holleyannwar and Subhramanya studying in their final year of Bachelor of Engineering. The main objective of this project is to assist in the social inclusion of elderly person and young person with disabilities. It is found that because of societal changes, social inclusion is going to be one of the major issue. Presently, the world is aging. Over 13% of worldâ€™s population is comprised of old aged. This is going to rise 3% every year according to survey conducted by US in 2018. So, we are building a development platform to test hardware framework in assisting these people. The hardware framework can act as a readymade platform to develop, test and deploy new software and features for suitable kind of application. 

This repostiory contains all the codes which are used in this project. The repostory is divided into two folders which are,

 1. [Matlab](Matlab/) contaiHumanoid walking has many advantages when compared to other locomotion techniques. Normal four-wheeled locomotion would not be effective on uneven surfaces. Hence, legged motion has significant advantages over traditional locomotion techniques. Research and development on this has been constantly improving during the last few decades. A stable walking gait is developed using model based design. Though legged locomotion is the most superior form of locomotion, however, in some situations twhe walking gait development files. 
 2. [ROS](ROS/usage_instruction.md) contains the Dynamixeleled locomotion would be stable and faster. Keeping this in mind, a hybrid robot is developed wherein it is able to shift from wheeled locomotion to legged locomotion and vice versa in very short time.

A 24 DOF humanoid robot is developed. The robot contains Intel NUC as the main controller and SLAM.
